### wikirepo 0.0.2 (Dec 8, 2020)

The minimum viable product of wikirepo:

- Users are able to query data from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) given locations, depth, time_lvl, and timespan arguments

- String arguments are accepted for Earth, continents, countries and disputed territories

- Data for greater depths can be retrieved by creating a dictionary given initial starting locations and going to greater depths using the [contains administrative territorial entity property](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P150)

- Data is formatted and loaded into a pandas dataframe for further manipulation

- All available social science properties on Wikidata have had modules created for them

- Estimated load times and progress are given

- The project's scope and general roadmap have been defined and detailed in the README
